## Plan your database schema

- Tools: Drawsql, figma?
- Purpose: To organise our data and to have a clearer idea of the data we need to manipulate
- Tip: use the Clerk userId as the primary key in the users table

## Note about this project's DB schema diagram

- For this assignment I should focus on game_title, game_review, users_table and perhaps an optional posts table. Only do topics, forum posts user comments and user_page comments if there's time.
